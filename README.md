# My-personal-porfolio

This repository is my **Personal Portfolio Website**.

During one of my UNI-brakes,  
I encountered this idea of building a gamified portfolio, essentially combining pixels and matrix.  
At first, I thought of simply making it a portfolio to showcase my projects and skills.  
However, one day when I was building my portfolio, I was struck by an idea: 

**"Why not create a portfolio that's unique and enjoyable for code enthusiasts to interact with?"**

While working on this project,  
I was captivated by how much creativity emerges when you have the freedom to think outside the box.  
Thinking and creating without limitations certainly gives birth to something purely original.   
However, I must caution you that this freedom to do (or in this case, write) whatever you want means you will have predefined directions.  
You will need to create your own directions.  
You'll be enticed by how much you will learn and create when working on something solo.

I've dedicated countless hours to this project in hopes that it inspires **new developers and aspiring engineers** to transform their unique ideas into something cool that they can admire, sparking creativity in others as well.
